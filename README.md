# Lab 6


For exercise 1, the challenge was to create an abstract shape made up of different elements this could be a rectangle, a triangle, or even a pentagon. Which I decided to make a smiley face. Then the next task was to change a characteristic/property of the shape using if-else statements and based differing conditions. based on three different conditions using if-else statements. I used mouseX with if-else statements to accomplish this. My if-else statements changed the smiley face to 4 different colors
